# Hanoi Real Estate Price Prediction using Crawled Data

This is my personal project to build a predictive model for real estate prices by crawling data from batdongsan.com,  cleaning, preprocessing, visualizing and applying machine learning models for evaluation.

### About The Project

In this project, I crawled data from [batdongsan.com.vn](https://batdongsan.com.vn) using Selenium. The main objective is to apply machine learning models to predict real estate prices.

### Main Steps Involved:

- **Data Crawling**: Using Selenium to crawl real estate listings.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing raw data using various Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Regex).
- **Modeling**: Using machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree) to predict real estate prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and distributions in the real estate data, such as location-based price trends, and correlations between property features.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the models' performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.


### Limitations and Future Work

The current model can be improved in several ways:

- Implementing more advanced deep learning models for price prediction.
- Increasing the dataset by scraping from multiple real estate websites.
- Incorporating external data sources like economic indicators and local amenities.
