# Hanoi-House-Price-Prediction
Real Estate Price Prediction using Crawled Data
This is my personal project to build a predictive model for real estate prices by crawling data from batdongsan.com, preprocessing, cleaning, and applying machine learning models for evaluation.

About The Project
In this project, I crawled data from batdongsan.com using Selenium. The main objective is to preprocess the data, clean it, and then apply machine learning models to predict real estate prices.

Main Steps Involved:
Data Crawling: Using Selenium to scrape real estate listings.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing raw data using various Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Regex).
Modeling: Using machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict real estate prices.
Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
